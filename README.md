# fb_posting_bot

This is my first python project since I wanted to learn by making stuff so that i Don't get caught up in basic.

basically all this project does is take posts/memes from reddit and post them to facebook.
(it now also mocks people in messenger,unless stopped using the command 'bela3')

this might be useful if you want to keep a page working or a keep a group from dying or something, I don't know.
(or piss off people because why not)

for now, this project can not deal with videos/gifs, only pictures and text or both.

the facebook xpath to post seems dependant on the account, if you wanted to use it you'll need to inspect element on the create a post button, input field, and the post button (in normal facebook version, I didn't try another account with the mbasic version yet).

you'd want to use the login_type function at the first time, then you can let it just login with cookies and loop everytime.
(this problem is fixed, just don't use different username)

I'll try to get it to do more though.
