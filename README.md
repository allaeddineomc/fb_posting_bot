# fb_posting_bot

YOU'LL NEED TO DOWNLOAD CHROME DRIVER BECAUSE IT USES SELENIUM

This is my first python project since I wanted to learn by making stuff so that i Don't get caught up in basic.

basically all this project does is take posts/memes from reddit and post them to facebook, you can edit the subreddits in the file called 'source'

it now also mocks people in messenger,unless stopped using the command 'bela3'.

it can now search the web with the command 'search' and send the first image from google.

it can now send a meme from reddit in messener using the command 'memebot'.


this might be useful if you want to keep a page working or a keep a group from dying or something, I don't know.
or piss off people because why not.
or just keep it for search and memes in a groupchat.

for now, this project can not deal with videos/gifs, only pictures and text or both.

the facebook xpath to post seems dependant on the account, if you wanted to use it you'll need to inspect element on the create a post button, input field, and the post button (in normal facebook version, I didn't try another account with the mbasic version yet), however the messages things work fine.

you'd want to use the login_type function at the first time, then you can let it just login with cookies everytime using your username.

I'll try to get it to do more though.
